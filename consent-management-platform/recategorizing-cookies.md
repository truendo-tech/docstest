# Recategorizing Cookies (Services)

<br />

After integrating TRUENDO and your first scan is performed. All cookies present will be categorized as Necessary, Preferences, Statistics, Social Content, Marketing or Additional Features. This is done by comparing the cookies TRUENDO finds with our database. Users are free to recategorize cookies as they see fit, we strongly encourage adhering to our conventions (ensuring compliance) but the choice is ultimately yours and this is done by reclassifying services.

<br />

<br />

## How to Recategorize Cookies/Services

1.  <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Login in to TRUENDO and </span></span> **select the website** you wish to alter.
2.  Navigate to **Services** and select the service you wish to edit, the panel on the right will display all the details relating to that service including the cookies it sets.
3.  Select **Category** and click **Edit**, you should now see the current category the service is classified into.
4.  Click the current category and **select the new category** you wish to move the service (and all its associated cookies) to.
5.  Once you have made your selection, click **Save** and you are done.

<div class="sd-callout" data-callout-type="alert"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> <u>You should not reclassify any cookie as Necessary unless you are sure it is</u>. Necessary cookies bypass consent request (the banner will not pop up if only Necessary cookies are detected) and thus if any service that isn't necessary does this, it is in direct violation of most privacy regulations including GDPR.</div>
