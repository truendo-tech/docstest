# Adding/Removing Services

TRUENDO scans each licensed domain once a month and automatically populates the respective service list accordingly. This is done by the crawler scanning the domain and comparing detected services to those in the TRUENDO service database.

<br />

If a user adds a new service to a domain and does not want to initiate a potentially time consuming domain scan then we advise adding the service manually such that all Policies and banners are up to date and compliant. The process is simple and detailed below.

<br />

## Adding a service

You must be logged in to TRUENDO and have selected the relevant <span style="color:rgba(59,103,251,1);">Organization</span> and <span style="color:rgba(46,204,113,1);">Domain</span> before proceeding

Selecting the domain is done by selection from the drop down menu at the top of the main TRUENDO menu.

#### Step 1

-   Navigate to the <span style="color:rgba(192,57,43,1);">Services</span> section of the menu, Now click the ADD SERVICE button (if you do not have any pending services). The Revisions drop down will now be visible and it will be in DRAFT mode.
    
    <br />
    
-   If you have previously added services but not yet published them to the active site then click the drop down titled <span style="color:rgba(241,196,15,1);">Revisions</span>, select DRAFT, this will display all the services you are going to add before Publishing.

#### Step 2

Click the blue "**ADD SERVICE**" button which appears in the central panel. A pop up window will appear.

#### Step 3

In the window that pops up select the type of service to be added (General is the default and contains services in the TRUENDO but if you have created [custom](http:#?target=0ZU-WJWI-LQM-OKD) services select this tab). Either search for the service required or scroll through the service list until the desired service is located and then select it. For info on the other two service categories click [here](http:#?target=ZGB-VI4B-V77-0MN).

<div class="sd-callout" data-callout-type="warning">If you cannot find the service, it may not be in our database and you will need to add it yourself, click <a href="http:#?target=0ZU-WJWI-LQM-OKD" target="_self">here</a> for information on how to do this..</div>

#### Step 4

Thereafter click **ADD SERVICE**.

<br />

#### Step 5

Repeat the above process for all services you wish to add and finally click the **PUBLISH** button in the top right of the window. You can switch the Revisions drop down to **Active** to see all the services you have published to the site.

<div class="sd-callout" data-callout-type="alert">It is adviseable to <strong>add only those services actually present on your website</strong> and this will directly affect your consent banner and all policies generated by TRUENDO</div>

## Removing a service

#### Step 1

Log in to TRUENDO, select the organization concerned

<br />

Step2

Select the domain you wish to remove a service from, this is done by selecting the domain from the drop down menu at the top of the main TRUENDO menu.

<br />

Step 3

<br />

#### Step 4

Click the name of the service to be removed in the central panel.

Step 7

Repeat the above for all services to be removed and click the **PUBLISH** buton in top right to confirm the removal from the live site.

<div class="sd-callout" data-callout-type="alert">All <strong>changes may take up to 15 minutes to reflect</strong> on your live website due to a CDN cache delay which requires this time to propagate to all nodes around the world.
