# Custom Services

TRUENDO now allows users to add services that are not already in the TRUENDO services database by themselves.

<div class="sd-callout" data-callout-type="alert">Please note that if you are adding any service the responsibility of ensuring all information regarding the service is correct is entirely yours. TRUENDO CMP accepts no legal responsiblity for any innacurate privacy relevant information.</div>

<div class="sd-callout" data-callout-type="warning">Custom services added are only available on a <strong>website to website basis</strong>. Meaning that if you have multiple websites in the same organization you will have to <strong>carry out the procedure below for each website</strong> on which the custom service is present.</div>

You must first be logged in to TRUENDO and have selected the relevant Organization and Website.

<br />

## Creating Custom Services

#### Step 1

It is always a good idea to make sure that the service you want to add is not already in our database. For more info [click here](http:#?target=EYK-JETN-ZGE-DY6).

<br />

#### Step 2

It is also advised to check if the service Vendor and Data Type the service collects/processes are currently in the TRUENDO database before adding a custom service. Click [here](http:#?target=3AE-FRIL-AVE-XAX) to see how to check this and add vendors or data types.

<br />

#### Step 3

If you cannot find the service you are looking for you are free to add it yourself. In TRUENDO click **Object Manager** from the panel in the left.
