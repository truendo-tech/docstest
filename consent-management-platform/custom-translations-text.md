2. Thereafter click **Translations** from the panel on the left
3. From the left most drop down menu select the part of TRUENDO for which you would like display text to be altered.

4. The default English text will appear on the left and the translated text or custom text will be displayed on the right.
5. Select the language for the new text, if you wish to use custom English texts for example: select English to English. These will be displayed to a website visitor relative to the languages the user has selected to display TRUENDO in.
6. Edit as you require and save all changes.
