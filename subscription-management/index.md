<span style="color:#0A0A0A;">Users may switch between Essentials and Premium subscriptions at any time, these options are located in the on the </span> **<span style="color:#0A0A0A;">Home</span>** <span style="color:#0A0A0A;"> page of the console.</span>

<br />

<span style="color:#0A0A0A;">In addition to increased customization options, subscribing to TRUENDO Premium allows users built-in management of 100k Unique Visitor consent records per year, regardless of number of page views or sessions. This means that, unless a visitor clears their cookies or uses an alternate device, they will only be deemed as a single unique visitor for a period of one year from first visiting your website. TRUENDO Premium will store consent records for these unique visitors.</span>
